		<p>My perfect trip would be a great Canadian trip because nothing says a perfect trip like the thought of travelling the land that was given to us by our ancestors and explore its natural and human made landmarks that define what Canada is and who we are as the people that live in this great country. We would start on the East coast and see sight like the Ch√¢teau Frontenac and the Olympic Stadium; we would then finish with the great rocky terrains of British Colombia and the West Coast of the Country.

		<p><strong>I would see animals like...</strong></p>

		Since this is a Great Canadian trip, we would see the animals that are known to be prominant in Canada. We would see the beaver because it is our national animal; we would see the loon because it is on our $1 coin, hence the name Loonie; and finally we would see Grizzly bears because they are awesome.

		<p><strong>I would eat food like...</strong></p>

		<p>Finally I would eat the greatest of traditional foods in Beaver tails, which is a pastry topped with whatever spread you want, Poutine, because of my French-Canadian roots, and Maple syrup, because this is the best thing to be created in the world.
