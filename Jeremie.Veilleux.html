				<br><b>Why did you take this class?</b>
				<br>When I was browsing for course in My Blueprint, I was searching for a course that would give me a challenge. When reading the description of the course, I found that the skills learned in the course could help me later on in life. Also, my friend told me that this course would be a fun and educational.

				<br>I have never programmed in my life.
				<br>
				<br><b>Is there anything specific you would like to learn?</b>
				<br>Honestly, I do not know what to exoect in this course, so I don't really have anything specific that I want to learn. Something that seems interesting though is C++.
