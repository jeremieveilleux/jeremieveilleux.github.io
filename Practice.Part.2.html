	<font color="white"><h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
	<p>A <b>volcano</b> is a location where magma, or hot melted rock from within a planet, reaches the surface. It may happen violently, in a massice supersonic explosion, or more quietly, as a sticky, slow lava flow.</p>
	<p>Volcanoes have been a part of the earth's history long before humans. Compare the history of human beings, a few million in the making to that of the Earth, over four <b><em>billion</em></b> years in the making.</p>

	<h2><b>Volcano Terminology</b></h2>
	<p>the study of volcanoes, or <em>Volcanology</em>, incloudes many odd terms. How many of these do you know?</p>
	<li><a>Caldera</a></li>
	<li><a>Vesicularity</a></li>
	<li><a>Pahoehoe</a></li>
	<li><a>Rheology</a></li>
	<li><a>Lahar</a></li>
	<p>The term <em>nu&eacute;e ardente</em>, or "glowing cloud" waws first used by La Croix(1904) in his descriptionof the volcanic flow he observed in the 1902 eruption of Mt. P&eacute;l&eacute;e, a historically active volcano on the island of Martinique.</p>
	<h2><b>Volcanic Places in the USA</b></h2>
	Listed below are two places in the United States that are considere "active" vlocanic areas.
	<br>
	<br><b>Mount St Helens</b>
	<br>On May 18, 1980, after a long period of rest, this quiet mountain in Washington provided detailed observations on the mechanics of highly explosive eruptions.
	<br>
	<br><b>Long Valley</b>
	<br>This field seismometer measures earthquakes associated with subsurface volcanic forces and may help to predict future event. It sits on a plateau known as the "Volcanic Tableland" formed by a major eruption 600,000 years ago.
